# The-Robin-3D-Printer-Project

The Robin 3D printers share the goal to be simple to build, based on a simple and
repeatable principle, and consist of parts that can be produced with smaller 3D printers.

### Robin
A simple to build 3D printer with a combined X/Y stage.
This printer can be used with very high accuracy as well as with very heavy print head assemblies,
because the print head does not move except in the Z-direction.

### Rob Plus
The Rob Plus 3D printer is build with an inverted-H-assembly, not unlike a coreXY setup, but
all steppers are connected along a single line, giving the printer a sleek but sturdy frame.
The Z-Axis can be built with either a single or a double-sided crane. The double-sided setup
is much less prone to vibrations, while the single-sided setup is very simple and good to
use as an educational sample.
